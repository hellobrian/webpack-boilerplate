# Webpack Boilerplate

Based on configuration from [SurviveJS | Developing with Webpack](http://survivejs.com/webpack_react/developing_with_webpack/).

Using this as a personal boilerplate for writing apps with Webpack (still work-in-progress).

Things it does today:
* Bundles and transpiles ES2015 and React code to ES5 compatible JavaScript
* Compile SCSS to CSS
* Sourcemaps for stylesheets
* Uses webpack-dev-server with hot-module-replacement

To-Do:
* Production scripts
